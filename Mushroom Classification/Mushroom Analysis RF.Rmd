```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Raw Data needed to be cleaned and processed

```{r mushrooms}
mushrooms = read.table(file = "~/Machine-Learning/Mushroom Classification/agaricus-lepiota.data", header = FALSE, sep = ",")
head(mushrooms)
```

## Cluster Plot

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
p = ggplot(data,aes(x=Odor, y=SporePrintColor, color=Edible))
p + geom_jitter(alpha=0.3) + scale_color_manual(breaks = c('Edible','Poisonous'),values=c('darkgreen','red'))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
